# Gnomix (Gubuntu) Website

## Overview

Gnomix is a static marketing website for a Linux distribution that offers Ubuntu without Canonical modifications, featuring stock GNOME desktop. The site is built as a single-page application using React, Vite, and modern UI components with a dark glassmorphism design aesthetic. It serves as a landing page to inform users about the project philosophy and provide download links.

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript in SPA (Single Page Application) mode
- **Router**: Wouter for client-side routing (lightweight alternative to React Router)
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui component library built on Radix UI primitives

**Component Structure**:
- Page-based routing with a single Home page and 404 fallback
- Modular component architecture with separate concerns:
  - Layout components (Navbar, Footer)
  - Section components (Hero, Features, Download, About)
  - Reusable UI primitives (FeatureCard, Button, Card, etc.)
- Example components in `examples/` folders for component development/testing

**Styling System**:
- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- Custom CSS variables for theme colors and design tokens
- Dark mode by default with glassmorphism design pattern
- Custom fonts: Inter for UI, JetBrains Mono for code/technical text
- Design guidelines documented in `design_guidelines.md` emphasizing glassmorphism effects, glow effects, and premium dark aesthetics

### Backend Architecture

**Static Site - No Backend Required**

This is a pure static site with no backend server. The frontend is a self-contained React application that doesn't make any API calls.

**Legacy Backend Code** (not used in production):
- `server/` directory contains Express.js setup but is not required for the static site
- TanStack Query is included in dependencies but unused (no API calls)
- Can be safely ignored for deployment purposes

**Design Decision**: The site was converted from a full-stack app to a static site for GitHub Pages deployment. All backend code remains in the codebase but is not executed in production.

### Build & Deployment

**Build Process**:
- Vite builds React app to `dist/public`
- Command: `npx vite build`
- Static assets (HTML, CSS, JS) output to `dist/public/`

**GitHub Pages Deployment (/docs folder method)**:
- **Method**: Deploy from Branch with /docs folder
- **Automatic Build**: GitHub Actions workflow builds and updates `/docs` on every push to `main`
- **Workflow**: Install dependencies → Build with Vite → Copy to /docs → Commit changes
- **Documentation**: See `DEPLOYMENT.md` for complete setup instructions

**Setup Process**:
1. Push code to GitHub repository
2. Configure Pages: Settings → Pages → Branch: main, Folder: /docs
3. Wait for GitHub Actions to build and update `/docs` folder
4. Site goes live with `index.html` at the web root

**Deployment Types**:
1. **User/Organization Page** (`username.github.io`)
   - No Vite configuration needed
   - Works immediately with /docs folder
   
2. **Project Page** (`username.github.io/repo-name`)
   - May require adding `base: '/repo-name/'` to `vite.config.ts`
   - See `DEPLOYMENT.md` for detailed instructions

**Important Files**:
- `docs/index.html` - Built static site entry point (generated by workflow)
- `docs/.nojekyll` - Prevents Jekyll processing
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - Builds and updates /docs automatically
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Complete deployment guide with troubleshooting

**Environment Modes**:
- Development: Vite dev server with HMR, Replit-specific plugins
- Production: Static files served via GitHub Pages CDN

**Recent Changes** (Nov 2025):
- Converted from Express-based full-stack app to pure static site
- Removed dependency on backend server for deployment
- Added GitHub Actions workflow for automatic deployment
- All styling and functionality preserved during conversion

## External Dependencies

### UI & Component Libraries
- **Radix UI**: Unstyled, accessible component primitives (20+ components including Dialog, Dropdown, Tooltip, etc.)
- **shadcn/ui**: Pre-styled components built on Radix with Tailwind
- **Lucide React**: Icon library
- **react-icons**: Additional icon sets (SourceForge icon)
- **Embla Carousel**: Carousel/slider functionality

### State Management & Data Fetching
- **TanStack Query v5**: Server state management, caching, and data synchronization
- **React Hook Form**: Form state management with validation
- **Zod**: Schema validation (integrated with Drizzle and React Hook Form via `@hookform/resolvers`)

### Styling & Design
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **tailwind-merge & clsx**: Utility class merging and conditional class names
- **class-variance-authority**: Type-safe variant styling
- **Autoprefixer & PostCSS**: CSS processing

### Database & Backend
- **Drizzle ORM**: Type-safe SQL ORM for PostgreSQL
- **@neondatabase/serverless**: Serverless PostgreSQL driver
- **drizzle-zod**: Zod schema generation from Drizzle schemas
- **connect-pg-simple**: PostgreSQL session store (prepared for future authentication)

### Development Tools
- **Vite**: Build tool and dev server
- **TypeScript**: Type safety across frontend and backend
- **esbuild**: Fast JavaScript/TypeScript bundler for server code
- **tsx**: TypeScript execution for development

### Replit Integration
- **@replit/vite-plugin-runtime-error-modal**: Development error overlay
- **@replit/vite-plugin-cartographer**: Code navigation (dev only)
- **@replit/vite-plugin-dev-banner**: Development environment banner (dev only)

### Fonts
- **Google Fonts**: Inter (UI text) and JetBrains Mono (code/technical text) loaded via CDN

### Asset Management
- Static assets stored in `attached_assets/` directory
- Vite alias configured for `@assets` import path
- Logo and favicon assets included

**Key Architectural Decisions**:
1. Static site approach prioritized for simplicity and GitHub Pages deployment
2. Database infrastructure prepared but not required for core functionality
3. Component library (shadcn/ui) chosen for consistency with modern React patterns
4. Glassmorphism design system requires careful attention to backdrop filters and transparency layers
5. Monorepo structure with shared types between client and server via `@shared` alias
